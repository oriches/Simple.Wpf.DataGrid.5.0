A port/migration of [Simple.Wpf.DataGrid](https://github.com/oriches/Simple.Wpf.DataGrid) WPF app from .Net 4.8 Framework to .Net X (Currently .Net 7.0).

Note: Used the [MS Upgrade Tool](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/upgrade-assistant/tutorial/install-upgrade-assistant), and then had to do some manual fixup afterwards.
